  "description": "Background * Undercooked is based on the game Overcooked where the main character will prepare ingredients which will be cooked and served.  * Orders will come in randomly and scores are based on how quickly the food is served after the order is placed.   * Orders will be a variation of either a plain pizza or a pepperoni pizza. * Ingredients will include dough, tomato, cheese, and pepperoni.   * Cooking will involve combining ingredients on a plate and putting it into an oven. * The game will end when the given time is up or if the player's oven catches on fire.",
