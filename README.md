Background
* Undercooked is based on the game Overcooked where the main character will prepare ingredients which will be cooked and served. 
* Orders will come in randomly and scores are based on how quickly the food is served after the order is placed.  
* Orders will be a variation of either a plain pizza or a pepperoni pizza.
* Ingredients will include dough, tomato, cheese, and pepperoni.  
* Cooking will involve combining ingredients on a plate and putting it into an oven.
* The game will end when the given time is up or if the player's oven catches on fire.
